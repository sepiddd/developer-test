## Frontend Task

### Use case

Our well-paying customer, Charles Duchemin, a well-known gourmet and the publisher of a famous restaurant guide, is waging a war against fast-food entrepreneur Tricatel to save the French art of cooking. For that reason he travels a lot and needs an easy to use way to share restaurant reviews with his staff.

### What we need

- a page allowing to submit reviews
- a page listing the reviews and linking to...
- ...a page allowing to edit the reviews (bonus!)

### Where to start

- start your app and check out what is already there
- we already stubbed the api methods needed
- visit [review](http://localhost:3000/reviews) page, which just shows the name of the first restaurant
